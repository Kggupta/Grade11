          <h2>File Management</h2>
          <ol>
              <li style="font-size: 15px">What is File Management? Explain it in your own words and expand on the basic definition.</li>
          </ol>
          The file management system (FMS) is the application that stores, arranges and accesses files on the storage disk. The FMS is used to allow users to store their documents on a device as well as view them and organize them however they wish, this includes using folders to group similar files together.
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>The basic capabilities of the FMS are:</strong>
          <ul>
              <li>Creating new files</li>
              <li>Showing the files stored on disk</li>
              <li>Moving files</li>
              <li>adding/changing metadata(basic information)</li>
              <li>Changing file organization based on properties (modified, created, size, extension)</li>
          </ul>
          The FMS allows for a simple interface versus the past where computers were run based on the command line. You would need to directly reference the file path using text such as <code>C:\Users\Keshav\Documents\Arduino\irremote</code>. Sure this may not be too hard with only a few files, but this will quickly become a problem when the number of files starts to rise. Imagine needing to keep track of the file path for EVERY SINGLE ONE of your documents!
          <br>
          <br>
          Not only that, but the FMS allows you to access files using dedicated applications using their “file extension” this consists of .doc, .py, .xls, etc…. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Just like anything in the field of software development, this system is being innovated, now the Document Management Software (DMS) is replacing the normal FMS. The DMS is an advanced FMS that includes many features and functions to make the basic capabilities of the FMS much faster and more efficient. As an example, with the DMS you can create your OWN file extension such as <strong>.myschoolnotes</strong> and connect it with certain attributes and metadata. This way, the DMS will group all the files with the <strong>.myschoolnotes</strong> file extension together, allowing you to keep all your files connected to school together. When you want to search for your notes, you can go directly to the search bar and enter this file extension and it will give you all the files with the <strong>.myschoolnotes</strong> extension even if they may be different file types. 
          <br>
          <br>
          In addition, the DMS allows sharing files (much like google drive). This new system is mainly used by businesses to hasten productivity and lower time spent searching for a lost file.

          <ol start="2" style="font-size: 15px">
              <li>What are some terms involved in file management? (e.g., path, parent folder, root, double-click, etc.) Define them.</li>
          </ol>
          See the <strong><a href="Terms.html">Terminology</a></strong> sub-page!
          <br>
          <br>
          <ol start="3" style="font-size: 15px">
              <li>Create a diagram (NO pasting an image, your own design of a drawing, map or picture, etc.) that demonstrates how files are organized in a computer system.</li>
          </ol>
          See the <strong><a href="FileDiagram.html">Diagram</a></strong> sub-page!
          <br>
          <br>
          <ol start="4">
              <li style="font-size: 15px">What is a drive? What are the drives on the school computers, and what do they represent? Name the drives you have on your personal computer (at home) and what storage area they represent. What is the difference between a network and a local drive?</li>
          </ol>
          A drive is a location where information can be stored and read. Drives are responsible for storing programs used by your computer, imagine you are typing up a book report using Microsoft word, the application is loaded from your hard DRIVE and once the report has been saved, it is also put onto the hard drive.<br><br>
          On the school computers (as well as personal computers) you have a few drives: See the <strong><a href="Terms.html">Terminology</a></strong> sub-page!
          <br>
          <br>
          A local drive is drive that is physically connected directly to your computer, such as your hard drive or disc drive. A network drive is a drive referencing a shared folder on another machine somewhere on the network. To put it simply: the local drive is device specific while the network drive can be accessed by anyone on the same network and with the right permissions.
          <br>
          <br>
          <ol start="5">
              <li style="font-size: 15px">What is a file extension? In a graphical user interface, what also identifies the program, a file will open in, or the type of application that will open it?</li>
          </ol>
          A file extension is a suffix at the end of all files. It proceeds a period and is usually three characters long. If you’ve ever used a modern computer before, you’ve probably noticed these letters at the end of your file.
          <br>
          <br>
          File extensions are important because it helps the OS to recognize what app opens when you double-click a file. This allows the computer to run much faster and avoid having to check EVERY SINGLE application you have to see if it will work. For example, a file named <i>picture.jpg</i> has the <i>jpg</i> file extension. When you open that file, the operating system looks for whatever app is associated with JPG files, opens that app, and loads the file. Although the choice of opening a file with a certain app is automatically chosen by the OS, you can do this manually by right clicking on the file you wish to open and select <strong>Open with...</strong>, it will then show you a list of apps and you can select any app that you want. Keep in mind that the computer usually knows what it is doing and playing around with how file extensions are set up may cause problems for you!

          <br>
          <ol start="6">
              <li style="font-size: 15px">Name at least 5 common extensions and what they are associated with.</li>
          </ol>
          <ol type="A">           
              <li><strong>.txt</strong><br>
                  Basic text file, all operating systems have a .txt file reader built-in, Apple has Pages, Windows has notepad, etc. This format has limited formatting capabilities but is useful for making quick text documents such as notes or reminders.</li>
              <li><strong>.doc/docx</strong><br>
                  The file extension for a Microsoft word document. It allows for more formatting and has a lot more features such as margins, page size, etc. .docx files can open as .txt files but you will lose a lot of formatting in the process.</li>
              <li><strong>.mp3</strong><br>
                  The standard audio file extension. Files with this extension are always audio files and are the most common type in computers everywhere. Some modern cell phones, however, use .mp4 or .m4r as ringtones and standard sound effects.</li>
              <li><strong>.jpg</strong><br>
                  Standard image file that stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group.</li>
              <li><strong>.png</strong><br>
                  This is the same as .jpg except that is has an alpha channel. Have you ever seen an image with a background that seemed like a checkerboard but showed up transparent when looked at? That is because of the alpha channel!</li>
              <li><strong>.mov</strong><br>
                  Standard video and audio file. It can be opened by iMovie, Quicktime, General browsers (Chrome, Explorer, Firefox…), Windows video player and more.</li>
              <li><strong>.bmp</strong><br>
                  Low-quality image file extension, it can be opened by any image processing application but has certain colour and resolution constraints. This is a file type we will probably use the most (along with .png) during the SDLC client summative project to design the sprites.</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <br>
          <ol start="7">
              <li style="font-size: 15px">State at least 5 tips/suggestions to naming and organizing files and folders.</li>
          </ol>
                    <ol type="A">           
              <li><strong>Use folders</strong><br>
                  Think about it, would you rather have a disc that looks messy? Or organised? <i>See left</i> As you accumulate files, the list will get bigger and bigger, so think about how much you will have to scroll with the first example when looking for a file versus dividing it up based on purpose. You can cut your searching time and increase productivity.</li>
              <li><strong>Organize by category</strong><br>
                  You can organize your folders and files is by category or type. Let’s say you have documents for school, work and personal as well as music and movies. Music, photos, videos and documents should all be kept separate. You can take this even further by creating separate folders for school, work and personal in the form of a broad category.</li>
              <li><strong>Naming conventions</strong><br>
                  when organizing files be as brief as possible, and as detailed as possible. You might be the only one using the folders or files, but if you share a file, either in a personal or professional setting, you want it to be clear to them. Don’t name a folder <i>2018 school things</i> name it <i>SchoolGrade11</i>. Keep in mind CAPITALIZATION!!! It will make your files easier to read when you have the first letter of every word capitalized and it looks nicer as well.<br><br> As a personal preference, I say never to use underscores in your names because this throws off the computers ability to organize alphabetically and makes it harder to read.</li>
              <li><strong>Use the favourites feature</strong><br>
                  In Windows, you can add a folder to <i>Favorites.</i> If it’s a folder you access a lot, but isn’t a part of the set folders that Windows has dubbed your <i>favourite</i>, you can drag and drop folders into that section. To ensure you actually have the folder in the Favorites section, look for the message saying <i>Create link in favourites</i>.</li>
              <li><strong>Archive, don’t delete</strong><br>
                  Do not delete files! You never know when it may come in handy again so you rarely want to do that. By storing folders containing files in a designated folder titled <i>Archive</i> you will be able to clean out your main folders of things you don't use anymore while keeping them just in case.<br><br> I can't tell you how many times I’ve deleted a file that I thought I would never need but a few months later it becomes a great tool for whatever comes up (such as a new project)!<br><br>You do want the <i>Archive</i> folder to be closer to the bottom of whatever directory you put it in but with a name like “Archive” it’ll likely be near the top. I fix this by adding “z”. at the beginning of it so that it goes to the bottom, now you won’t have to worry about it being in the way all the time!</li>
              <li><strong>Back up frequently!</strong><br>
                  Computers experience problems all the time, it happens. But sometimes, your files can get corrupted and if you are really unlucky, it will be the important ones that get hurt. So always try to save your documents to a secondary storage system such as a mass storage device, USB drive or the cloud. Better to be safe than sorry!</li>
