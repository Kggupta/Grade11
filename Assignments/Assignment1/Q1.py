#Write a program that shows the use of all 9 math operations. Simple print statements will do. For example:
#print ("4+5=",4+5)
#Find ONE more operation that is NOT listed here and use it in your program too. Try all these operations (NOT all in one statement please!): +, -, *, /, //, **, %, +=, -=
#Note: anything containing an = sign needs to be used as an assignment statement. Then you can print the answer.
#   For example:
#       x=3
#       x+=2
#       print (x)

print("6+7=", 6+7)
print("6-7=", 6-7)
print("6*7=", 6*7)
print("7/6=", 7/6)
print("7//6=", 7//6)
print("7**6=",7**6)
print("23%3=", 23%3)

num=7
print(num)
num+=2
print(num)

num2=89
print(num2)
num2+=1
print(num2)

print(7>6)#special operator will compare the two givens and return true or false
