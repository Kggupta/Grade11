            As a beginner should I learn Swift, Objective-C, or both?
        </font><!-QUESTION 1-!>
        <br>
        <br>
        <font style="font-size: 20px;color: white">
            This depends on whether you will be working for a iOS company or as an independant developer.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If you want to work as a dedicated iOS developer or in a large company: The best choice would be both. This is due to the fact that most companies like that have existing Objective-C code from when swift was still in version 1 and 2. Some companies wont trasition to Swift at all and some companies are in the midst of it. To keep the most oportunities open it is best to learn both so as not to limit yourself to a certain type of company
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you are an idependant developer, you can choose to learn only Swift and you could get by with no problem.        
                </li>
            </ul>   
            This answer may change as time goes on and Swift gains more popularity so keep in mind that the state of the software development profession is constantly changing.

                Will Swift replace Objective-C or be an add-on?
            </font><!-START OF QUESTION 2-!>
            <br>
            <br>
            Swift will never replace Objective-C, a statement from apple confirmed this when they said, "Objective-C is not going away, both Swift and Objective-C are first class citizens for doing Cocoa and Cocoa Touch development."<br>
            Objective-C is here to stay, but in the past year Apple seems to be encouraging the use of Swift more and more. As an educated guess, it's very possible that Apple will slowly stop updating the C framework and API development. Perhaps Obj-C may become deprecated in favor of Swift some day.

                What does "playground" mean in Swift?
            </font><!-START OF QUESTION 3-!>
            <br>
            <br>
            The playground is not a fancy structure with slides and monkey bars when talking about Swift. A playground is a file where snipets of code can be written and the results can be seen right away on the console. Personally this is really useful for prototyping code on the fly instead of putting it directly into the main file and risking a crash.
