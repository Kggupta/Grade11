          <!--Start of question-->
          <ol>
              <li style="font-size: 15px">Describe, on the basis of research, how and where recycled electronic wastes is processed, and identify local companies and institutions that offer such services.</li>
          </ol>
          <!--Answer to question-->
          <p>The majority of E-Waste ends up in landfills, a small percentage comes back in new devices. According to a 2015 study, in 2014, 41.8 million tons of electronic waste (e-waste) was discarded, with only 10 percent of disposal done ethicaly. Electronics are full of valuable materials, many of the materials used in making these electronic devices can be recovered, reused and recycled, including plastics, metals, and glass. In a report, Apple revealed that it recovered 2,204 pounds of gold ($40 million) from recycled iPhones, Macs and iPads in 2015.</p>
          <p>The process for proper recycling is as follows:</p>
          <table class="wp-table"><!--Sable to explain the ewaste process-->

                  <td>When there are usually large bins or booths where a person can come in and drop off as many electronics as they want. Sometimes the seller even offers some money for those who recycle their E-Waste mainly as an insentive to recycle rather than throw it out.</td><!--Explanation-->

              <tr>
                  <td>Transport</td>
                  <td>Large trucks arrive and load with all the waste from the collection sites and brings it to the recyling plants and facilities.</td>

                  <td>Separation</td>
                  <td>After the waste arrives at the facility, materials are cleaned and removed of their possible toxic components. They are then separated into different categories such as CPU, Hard Drives, RAM, outer body, etc. An efficient method of separation is the key to E-Waste recycling. It must be fast and cheap otherwise the appeal for corporations to contribute to the recycling initiative will dissapear due to their inherent desire to make money.</td>

                  <td>Shredding</td>
                  <td>Shredding is when the different metals and circuitry are removed from their main PCB. The PCD is usually made of a material that be be easily ground up and turned back into a new PCB so the boards are now put in a seperate place. The metals are then melted down in a safe way to minimize health hazards and environmental concerns, they are now ready to be resold to make new PCB's. THe plastics are shredded down to less than 100mm and preped for the separate plastic recycling process. An overhead magnet separates the magnetized metals from the plastics and a water sifting technique is used to separate the plastic from the glass. </td>
