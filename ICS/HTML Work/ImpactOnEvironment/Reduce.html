          <h2>Reducing Negative Effects</h2>
          <ol>
              <li style="font-size: 15px">Identify measures that help reduce the negative effects of computers on the environment</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Upon the arival of the computer, it changed our lives, but it also can affect both the environment and our health. With the many negative effects a computer brings alongside its helpful attributes, there are many ways in which we can reduce these negative effects. </p>
          <p>For example, e-waste. E-waste is a term used for electronic products nearing the ending of their life and will be discarded. Computers are essentially a mass of toxic materials so once they are thrown out by their owner those toxins are released into the atmosphere. This negative effect can be resolved by recycling your E-waste and recycle the parts used for future electronics and products. Recycling e-waste reduces negative effects on the environment so that the harmful toxins in the computers are disposed safely without harming the environment.</p> 
          <p>You can do even more, as computers create alot of paperwaste by printing out documents. To reduce this you should always make an effort to recycle your paper so that it can be re used. Consider this, what if schools and workplaces never hand out another paper again, insead they can upload the document to the cloud where you can see it online without creating unnecessary print-outs.</p>
          
          <p>Lastly, the issue of power consumption. To solve this, simply remember to turn off your computer when you are not using it! Not only will this help cut down on your electricity bill, but it will also increase the lifespan of your devices! Some small things that can be done are:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Adjusting computer brightness</li>
              <li>Using LCD or OLED monitors.</li>
              <li>Use a powerstrip that automatically cuts power at a certain time</li>
              <li>Use <font color="green">Energy Saver</font> devices</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Instead of throwing out your devices, you should learn how to upgrade a computer instead of buying a new computer. Theoretically this should actually be CHEAPER than buying a new device whenever one breaks. Schools should learn to use the Internet as the source of assignments and a supplement over paper which is wasted for assignments that could have been sent via email and therefore saving paper.</p> 
          <p>Please keep in mind that some people take advantage of others who are trying to save power and help the environment by selling products with the name "SMART POWER SAVER" or "INTELLIGENT POWER UNIT". These are scams and you should not entertain these products as they actually cause more damage. Inside the device is usually a single capacitor or a full bridge rectifier with an LED and resitor. These products are designed to seem like they are working while they really just suck up power and waste money. They use jargan such as "improves power factor" or "optimises current draw to baseline" to throw you off but it is important to know not to fall for these tricks. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXRmdDAWHMg">this video</a> for some proof</p>

          <ol start="2" style="font-size: 15px">
              <li>Describe ways in which computers are or could be used to reduce resource use and to support environmental protection measures</li>
          </ol>
          Computers are not all bad however, as they can actually contribute to reducing resource consumption and contribute to the protecting the environment.
